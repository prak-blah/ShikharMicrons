## Key Facts

- Calcite powder: CaCO₃, formula weight 100.09 g/mol, Mohs hardness 3, brightness 95–98%
- Dolomite powder: CaMg(CO₃)₂, Mohs hardness 3.5–4, contains both calcium and magnesium carbonate
- GCC (Ground Calcium Carbonate): Mechanically ground natural CaCO₃, 97–99% purity, used in paper (40–50% of global GCC usage), plastics, paints, rubber
- GCC vs PCC: GCC is ground from natural rock (lower cost, variable particle shapes); PCC is chemically precipitated (higher purity, uniform particles, higher cost)
- Limestone powder: Sedimentary rock, 95–98% CaCO₃, used in construction, agriculture, water treatment
- Coated powders: Stearic acid surface treatment creates hydrophobic mineral fillers for improved polymer compatibility
- Mesh to micron formula: Microns = 25,400 ÷ Mesh Number
- Manufacturing locations: Alwar and Makrana, Rajasthan, India
- Industries served: Paints, plastics, rubber, paper, glass, ceramics, construction, agriculture, water treatment, adhesives
