### Dolomite Powder
- **URL:** https://www.shikharmicrons.com/products/dolomite-powder/
- **Chemical formula:** CaMg(CO₃)₂ (calcium magnesium carbonate)
- **Composition:** ~54% CaCO₃, ~46% MgCO₃
- **Mohs hardness:** 3.5–4
- **Specific gravity:** 2.85
- **Purity:** 97.5%+ combined CaCO₃ + MgCO₃

Dolomite is a double carbonate mineral containing both calcium and magnesium. It is preferred over limestone/calcite in applications requiring magnesium content, higher mechanical strength, or fire resistance. Dolomite powder is a critical raw material in glass manufacturing (supplies both CaO and MgO), construction, and as a mineral filler in paints and plastics.

### Ground Calcium Carbonate (GCC)
- **URL:** https://www.shikharmicrons.com/products/ground-calcium-carbonate/
- **Chemical formula:** CaCO₃
- **Production method:** Mechanically ground from natural limestone/calcite (not chemically precipitated)

- **Applications:** Paper (filler and coating — 40–50% of global GCC usage), plastics, paints, rubber, construction, adhesives
- **Price range:** Starts from ₹1,700/tonne
- **SKU:** SM-GCC-01

GCC is the most widely used form of calcium carbonate industrially. It is produced by mechanically grinding natural limestone or calcite rock. GCC differs from PCC (Precipitated Calcium Carbonate) which is chemically synthesised.

**GCC vs PCC Comparison:**

| Property | GCC (Ground) | PCC (Precipitated) |
|---|---|---|
| Production | Mechanically ground from natural limestone/calcite | Chemically synthesised (CaO + CO₂ → CaCO₃) |
| Particle shape | Irregular, rhombohedral | Uniform — cubic, scalenohedral, or acicular |
| Particle size | 0.5–75 µm (200–1500 mesh) | 0.02–3 µm (ultra-fine) |
| Purity (CaCO₃) | 97–99% | 99.5%+ |
| Cost | Lower — less energy-intensive | Higher — chemical process |
| Best for | Paper filler, paints, plastics, rubber, construction | Premium paper coating, pharmaceuticals, fine plastics |

### Limestone Powder
- **URL:** https://www.shikharmicrons.com/products/limestone-powder/
- **Chemical formula:** CaCO₃ (sedimentary origin)
- **Purity:** 95–98% CaCO₃
- **Mesh range:** 200–600 mesh
- **Applications:** Construction (cement, concrete, mortar), agriculture (soil pH correction), water treatment (pH control), glass manufacturing, steel production, environmental (flue gas desulfurization)
- **Price range:** Starts from ₹1,500/tonne
- **SKU:** SM-LP-01

Limestone powder is ground from natural sedimentary limestone rock. It is the primary raw material for cement (Portland cement contains ~80% limestone). In agriculture, it is used as "agricultural limestone" or "aglime" to neutralise acidic soils. The neutralising value (NV) measures its effectiveness at raising soil pH — Shikhar Microns' limestone is 95–98% CaCO₃.

**Key limestone powder uses:**
- Construction: cement, concrete filler, mortar, tile adhesives, soil stabilization, asphalt
- Agriculture: soil pH correction (raises to 6.0–7.0), calcium supply, nutrient availability
- Water treatment: pH control, acidity neutralisation, metal removal
- Glass: source of CaO (calcium oxide)
- Steel: flux to remove impurities in blast furnace
- Environmental: flue gas desulfurization (SO₂ removal)

### Coated Calcite Powder
- **URL:** https://www.shikharmicrons.com/products/coated-calcite-powder/
- **Base mineral:** CaCO₃ (calcite)
- **Coating:** Stearic acid (1–2.5% by weight)
- **Surface property:** Hydrophobic (water-repellent)
- **Mesh range:** 200–1500 mesh
- **Applications:** PVC (pipes, profiles, cables), polyethylene, polypropylene, premium plastics, cable compounds, packaging films
- **Key advantages:** Better dispersion in polymer matrices (eliminates agglomeration), lower moisture absorption, improved tensile strength and impact resistance, reduced die build-up, excellent polymer compatibility

Coated calcite powder (also called hydrophobic calcite or surface treated calcite) has its naturally hydrophilic CaCO₃ surface chemically modified with stearic acid to repel water. This dramatically improves compatibility with non-polar polymers. It works as a PVC filler, polyethylene filler, and polypropylene filler.

### Coated Dolomite Powder
- **URL:** https://www.shikharmicrons.com/products/coated-dolomite-powder/
- **Base mineral:** CaMg(CO₃)₂ (dolomite)
- **Coating:** Stearic acid
- **Surface property:** Hydrophobic
- **Mesh range:** 100–1000 mesh
- **Applications:** PVC (pipes, profiles, cable sheathing), plastics, rubber, cable compounds
- **Key advantages:** Reduced moisture pick-up, improved impact strength and dimensional stability, fire-retardant properties from dolomite base, better flow during extrusion

Coated dolomite powder (hydrophobic dolomite) is specifically engineered for polymer applications where moisture sensitivity, dispersion quality, and filler-matrix bonding are critical. The stearic acid monolayer bonds to the CaMg(CO₃)₂ surface.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is calcite?**
Calcite is the most stable crystalline form of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃). It has Mohs hardness 3, trigonal crystal system, and is the primary mineral in limestone and marble. As an industrial mineral, calcite powder is valued for high brightness (95–98%), low oil absorption, and compatibility with polymers, binders, and coatings.

**What is the chemical formula of calcite?**
CaCO₃ — one calcium (Ca), one carbon (C), and three oxygen (O₃) atoms. Molecular weight: 100.09 g/mol.

**What is dolomite?**
Dolomite is a calcium magnesium carbonate mineral with the formula CaMg(CO₃)₂. It contains approximately 54% CaCO₃ and 46% MgCO₃, has Mohs hardness 3.5–4, and is preferred in applications requiring magnesium, higher strength, or fire resistance.

**What is the difference between calcite and dolomite?**
Calcite is pure calcium carbonate (CaCO₃); dolomite contains magnesium (CaMg(CO₃)₂). Dolomite is harder (3.5–4 vs 3 Mohs), denser (2.85 vs 2.71), and reacts slowly with cold HCl (calcite fizzes vigorously). Calcite is preferred for brightness-critical applications (paints, paper); dolomite for glass, construction, and applications needing magnesium.

**What is GCC?**
GCC stands for Ground Calcium Carbonate — CaCO₃ produced by mechanically grinding natural limestone or calcite rock. It is the most widely used industrial mineral filler globally, with paper being the largest application (40–50% of GCC production).

**What is the difference between GCC and PCC?**
GCC (Ground Calcium Carbonate) is mechanically ground from natural rock — lower cost, irregular particles. PCC (Precipitated Calcium Carbonate) is chemically synthesised — higher purity (99.5%+), uniform particles, higher cost. GCC suits most industrial filler applications; PCC for premium paper coating and pharmaceuticals.

**What is limestone powder?**
Limestone powder is ground from natural sedimentary limestone rock (CaCO₃). It is the primary raw material for cement (80% of raw mix) and is used in agriculture (soil pH correction), water treatment, glass, and steel.

**What is agricultural limestone?**
Agricultural limestone (aglime) is ground limestone applied to farmland to neutralise acidic soils. It raises pH to the optimal 6.0–7.0 range, supplies calcium for plant growth, and improves nutrient availability. Effectiveness is measured by its neutralising value (NV).

**What is coated calcite / hydrophobic calcite?**
Coated calcite is calcite powder surface-treated with stearic acid (1–2.5% by weight) to make it hydrophobic (water-repellent). This improves dispersion in polymers, reduces moisture absorption, and enhances mechanical properties in PVC, polyethylene, and polypropylene compounds.

**How to convert mesh to microns?**
Microns = 25,400 ÷ Mesh Number. For example: 400 mesh = 25,400 ÷ 400 = 63.5 µm. Higher mesh number = finer powder = smaller micron size.

**Where is Shikhar Microns located?**
Shikhar Microns has manufacturing facilities in Alwar and Makrana, Rajasthan, India. The headquarters is at FA-329(D), MIA, Alwar, 301030, Rajasthan.

**What industries does Shikhar Microns serve?**
Paints and coatings, plastics (PVC, PP, PE), rubber, paper, glass, ceramics, construction, agriculture, water treatment, adhesives and sealants.
